/// details | Why a new mkdocs theme while `material` exists?
First the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) theme is just incredible. 

Actually, nothing can compete with the [material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme which is very mature and feature rich. 

In addition to sticking to the shadcn theme, the idea is to remain a simple theme, providing some special built-in features that we may not find in other themes.
///


/// details | Is it open to contributions?
Yes, yes and yes! On its own, the theme tries to provide more and more relevant extensions/plugins. But anyone can define what could be relevant! 

[Open an issue](https://github.com/asiffer/mkdocs-shadcn/issues) and let us discuss about it +heroicons:face-smile+
